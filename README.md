# Parallel-text-processing-using-MapReduce-MR-and-Hadoop-Distributed-File-System-HDFS

This problem was provided by researchers in the Classics department at UB. They have provided
two classical texts and a lemmatization file to convert words from one form to a standard or
normal form. In this case several passes through the documents were done. 


Pass 1: Lemmetization using the lemmas.csv file


Pass 2: Identify the words in the texts by <word <docid, [chapter#, line#]> for two documents>.


Pass 3: Repeat this for multiple documents.
